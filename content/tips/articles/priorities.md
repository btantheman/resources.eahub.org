### _Published 22nd September 2019_

_This section was written by the LEAN team, utilising some ideas gained from EA Oxford and EA MIT._ 

Given that groups will be time- and/or funding-constrained to some extent, prioritising between activities is very important. This could be affected by several factors, such as the age and stage of development of your group, the demographic, needs and preferences of your members, and your organisers’ particular skill-sets.

To begin prioritising, you need to determine what stage of development your group is at. Below 3 different group states are identified, organized by group size. **All priorities from the earlier states apply to the later states.**

The following is a suggested method of prioritising tasks, but is by no means fixed. Different groups may benefit from different models of prioritisation. It is useful to create a document which lists your group’s priorities (you can always adapt the one below) and revisit it at fixed intervals (every 6 months, or at the end of every semester) to evaluate which tier your group is in, and whether you need to adjust how many goals you are targeting.

## Small/New

Characteristics: Approximately 1-2 group organisers and <10 regular group members.

Priorities could be:

* Making a positive, healthy community people want to be a part of.
* Creating and maintaining relationships with the EA community and those offering <a target="_blank" href="/tips/support/">group support</a>. 
* Find co-organisers (Check out some tips for <a target="_blank" href="/start/run-city-group#coorganiser/">City Groups</a> and <a target="_blank" href="/start/run-uni-group#coorganiser/">Uni Groups</a>)
* If the current organisers may leave (e.g. Uni groups), find successors to ensure the group continues. Create a <a target="_blank" href="/tips/handover/">preliminary handover process</a>.
* Build and maintain a core group.

## Medium Sized
Medium sized groups have the ability to maintain or grow, but many are at risk of losing this capacity and contracting unless they develop failsafes and infrastructure to prevent this from happening. 

Characteristics: Approximately 3-5 group organisers, and 10-20 regular group members.

Priorities could be:

* Make valuable connections between people in the group and the broader EA community.
* Develop an overarching group strategy and object level goals to achieve in a given time frame.
* Develop infrastructure to help maintain the group’s current level of activity, this can involve developing more <a target="_blank" href="/tips/articles/committee/">formalised group roles</a>.
* Have a <a target="_blank" href="/tips/handover">robust handover process</a> if the current organisers may leave.
* Hold a variety of activities that might work to increase engagement in <a target="_blank" href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/the-funnel-model/">all parts of the funnel model of engagement</a> in EA. This includes:
   * Moving people from “audience” to “followers” in the funnel model. This involves outreach to people who haven’t heard of EA before.
   * Moving people from “followers” to “participants”. This could involve holding events that help new people become more knowledgeable about EA.
   * Moving people from “participants” to “contributors” by providing support for people to conduct projects, volunteer, attend conferences, or make significant commitments.
   * Moving people from “contributors” to “core” by assisting people with their career plans.


## Large
At this stage, your group will be established in the local community for at least a few years, and reach a size at which it is very unlikely to stop existing. 

Characteristics: Usually more than 5 organisers who invest substantial time into the group, possibly including paid part- or full-time organisers. Active membership of 50+ members, large enough to support subcommunities, for example groups based on different interest areas. 

Priorities could be:

* Maintaining all the priorities listed under a medium sized group.
* Attracting new members who might be particularly valuable to the EA community. 
* Providing resources to support new EA projects.
* Organising showpiece events with high-profile speakers. 
* Maintaining an excellent brand-presence (e.g. social media, website).

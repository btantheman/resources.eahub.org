### _Updated 24th August 2021_

The editing software most commonly used by groups is

1. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.canva.com/">Canva</a>
2. <a target="_blank" href="https://designer.gravit.io/">Gravit</a>

Canva is easier to use but much less flexible than Gravit. Both software can be used for free on your web browser.

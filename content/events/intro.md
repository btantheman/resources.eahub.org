These workshops and talks are designed for audiences that are unfamiliar with effective altruism. They could be used for newcomers events, or for presenting to non-EA groups. This page has interactive workshops and talks of a variety of lengths. If you have only a short amount of time with the group then delivering a talk will probably suit best. If you have more time an interactive workshop is recommended, as the activities help participants engage with the ideas, and the opportunity for questions allows for questions and misconceptions to be addressed.

First impressions are very important, so it is worth learning about how to best present EA, and how to avoid the most common pitfalls. The <a target="_blank" href="/learn/communicate-ea/">guide on communicating about EA</a> covers a variety of ways of expressing EA concepts and common questions and objections. Catherine Low has also produced <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FURw0YwQkb4ZPiGE0MQwbSKBbbWuI7gDsIjMbBcA_VA/">this guide on running introductory workshops and presentations</a> which provides some useful tips.

# Videoed Talks

One option for an intro to EA event is to play a video introduction to EA, and then discuss the ideas with your group. This might be a good option if you have little time to prepare, your organisers are not confident public speakers, or your group is small so a casual event would be more appropriate.

Two options:

* Will MacAskill's TED talk from 2018: <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WyprXhvGVYk&feature=youtu.be">"What are the most important moral problems of our time"</a> (12 minutes).

* Ajeya Cotra's more in-depth <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48VAQtGmfWY">introduction to EA from EAGxBerkeley in 2016</a> (35 minutes).

# Introductory Talks

The links provide slides and a suggested script for an EA talk. It is recommended that you also add in personal information about what drew you to EA, and how these ideas affected you.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1u2SHkoo_Ns-OkzOj897Z6mPMkDmHkGmT?usp=sharing">Eric Gastfiriend's introduction to EA</a> (16 minutes). This was used as a guest lecture in a Rationality class. 

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1vqg2hFzlazg6qi8n2j44jzBOANok-ao1?usp=sharing">EA New Zealand's introduction to EA</a> (20 minutes). This is used to introduce EA to non-EA clubs and workplaces. 

*  <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1kUZUC-addsdDJTaR6QhOnZ6jjqZOi1pS?usp=sharing">EA New Zealand's very short introduction to EA</a> (5 minute version). This is a mini version of the above talk. It is used to briefly introduce EA at the start of group events when newcomers are attending. It can be used with or without slides. 

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PMOPsZRJ2u4ENfEbYP7FNDsARiG0iqPl?usp=sharing">EA Stanford's introduction to EA</a> (35 minutes). This is based on Ajeya Cotra's talk linked above. 

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TX7xrH54OwFbph3dBvbxa-RqvVw-3dAw?usp=sharing">EA Stanford's short introduction to EA</a> (10 minutes). This is a short version of the above talk. 

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1PMOPsZRJ2u4ENfEbYP7FNDsARiG0iqPl?usp=sharing">Social Programs Quiz</a> (5 minutes). This is a fun activity that can be slotted into intro talks if you have time. Participants have to guess whether each of four social programs do good, cause harm, or have no measured effect. Very few people get all four correct so it is a good activity to demonstrate that we need evidence and analysis to work out how to improve the world. It is based off <a target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/articles/can-you-guess/">80,000 Hours' social programs quiz</a>.

# Interactive Workshops





## Introduction to EA with Giving Game
A great way of introducing EA concepts is through a giving game, where people choose a charity to give a pot of money to - it is more engaging than lectures, and provides a concrete example of the use of EA principles. A giving game can be used for presentations taking 45 mins or longer.

<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1k73rGGdiI90vFl8Z1iOyLfTbJefgATM9?usp=sharing">This Google Drive folder</a> contains all the materials needed to run an introduction to EA involving a Global Health and Poverty Giving Game. This presentation takes about 1.5 hours, but can be adapted to shorter and longer times. It includes powerpoint slides, a sample script, handouts about the charities, frequently asked questions, and a video of this presentation in action. This presentation (or variations on this presentation) has been used with over 100 audiences.

For introductions to EA it is usually best to restrict charities to a single cause cause area (usually global poverty unless the audience is particularly interested in another cause are), as cross-cause area giving games often involve the participants choosing based on their current favourite cause, rather than applying evidence. The breadth of EA can be explained after the game.

For global poverty focused giving games, the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/">Life You Can Save</a> can sponsor money to go to the charity the students choose. They will sponsor $5 (or 5 Euro or 5 pounds) for each high school student, $10 for each university student, or $20 for each professional. For details on sponsorship go to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/giving-games">the Life You Can Save's guide</a>.

## Introduction to EA with Cause-Prioritisation Activity

Cause-prioritisation is one of the most important and unique aspects of EA. While it is a difficult job to choose between different cause areas, it is possible to introduce the concepts of cause-prioritisation in a 1 to 1.5 hour introduction to EA.

This <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Sqitu3q8b4NJZ95ec_O1n3_zHkrNCE8U?usp=sharing">Google Drive folder</a> has all the materials needed for a workshop that introduces EA, and gives participants an activity to use the Scale, Neglectedness, Solvability framework to assess 3 to 6 cause areas. It includes powerpoint slides, a sample script, information sheets on 6 cause areas and a worksheet.


## Introduction to EA with Animal Charity Giving Game

This 1 to 1.5 hour introduction to EA with a giving game involving animal charities is designed for introducing EA to animal rights and vegan groups. The giving game has people choosing between The Humane League, the Good Food Institute, and a local animal shelter that focuses on pets. 

This <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/12nRkyD_F_TCdAWP2MGWGNO_woaUjpJgy">Google Drive folder</a> has a powerpoint slide and a handout about the charities for this presentation. You'll need to change some of the information to suit your local area, and ideally find out the number of animals helped per year by an animal shelter near you, and the annual expenditure of that shelter to allow for a cost-effectiveness comparison.

Note: This presentation isn't as well resourced or as referenced as the ones above.

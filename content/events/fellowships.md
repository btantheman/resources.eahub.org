# TL;DR
Fellowships are multi-week reading- and discussion groups for committed participants. 
Introductory fellowships can be great for giving people an in-depth understanding of EA ideas and building your EA group, if you have the capacity to run one. They’ve also been used to start new groups successfully. Some groups also run in-depth and cause area specific fellowships.
You can also consider sending your group members to <a target="_blank" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/virtual-programs/">EA Virtual Programs’ introductory program</a>.
If you’re interested in running your own introductory fellowship, there are lots of template resources available, as well as funding and one-on-one support.

# What is a fellowship? 
EA fellowships (also sometimes known as EA Programs, Scholar's Programs, or Seminar Programs) are small groups of admitted fellows who meet multiple times to learn about some aspect of effective altruism. Fellowships are an excellent way of providing people with a solid understanding of effective altruism principles and motivation to take action. They also generally create consistent attendance and shared understanding better than one-off events. 

Many groups run fellowships for their own community, and online fellowships open to people from anywhere in the world are advertised on the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/virtual-programs/">EA Virtual Programs platform</a>.

<a name="should"></a>


# Should I run a fellowship?
CEA has found that fellowships are one of the most effective ways to set people up with engagement in the effective altruism movement longer-term. However, they take a significant amount of time to run, and poorly-run fellowships run the risk of putting off people who might otherwise be interested in EA, so we encourage you to think carefully about whether your group is well-suited to run one.

A fellowship might be a good fit for your group if your organisers:

* Are confident at public speaking and <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/events/articles/discussion-tips/">facilitating discussions</a>
* Have plenty of time to plan and execute the fellowship
* Have good organisational skills
* Are very familiar with EA

If you'd like your group members to be able to attend a fellowship, but you don't want to run one right now, you can recommend that they sign up for <a target="_blank" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/virtual-programs/">EA Virtual Programs</a> who run online Intro and In-Depth Fellowships starting every month.

Yi-Yang Chua, who runs EA Virtual Programs, <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/tn328tcnrKiEMb7Lr/should-you-organise-your-own-introductory-ea-program-or">wrote a forum post about when groups should run their own fellowship</a>, collaborate with an experienced organiser, or collaborate with EA Virtual Programs.

# How to run an Introductory Fellowship 
<a name="curriculum"></a>



## Curriculum
Introductory fellowships typically have a curriculum with weekly readings (and sometimes exercises) that is distributed to participants. Participants do the readings in advance of a weekly fellowship session and then discuss the readings in-session.

**<a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15HJdBYFyeyG9yVbJ_QDvm811A9IHnC4Y?usp=sharing">This folder contains the most tested and frequently updated curriculum (see "3 – Curriculum")**. 

The folder also contains a guide for organisers and facilitators running this program.
 

This is an 8-week curriculum with 1-2 hours of reading per week and 1-1.5h weekly discussion sessions. The curriculum was developed by EA Oxford and CEA in 2020 with assistance from a variety of experts; trialed over 2020 and 2021; and updated based on this feedback. We think this fellowship is an excellent way to introduce people to effective altruism, and we encourage groups to consider using the curriculum. (Note that this curriculum contains chapters from Doing Good Better and The Precipice, so you'll need to buy these books for your participants or make sure they have access to them otherwise. You can get books for fellowships funded by CEA – see the "<a href="">Fellowship funding and support</a>" section below.)

There are several other pre-made curricula that you can use; see the "<a href="">Further resources</a>" section of this page. We encourage you to think about which curriculum will work best for your group, but we recommend the curriculum above as a good starting point..
<a name="format"></a
## Format
Different groups use different formats. Here are three options:

* The most common option: Accept many applicants from a pool and split them into groups of 3-5 fellows. Assign a facilitator to each group. The groups can meet at different times of the week for weekly discussions. Groups using this model often have social events for all their fellows. 
* Invite approximately 15 people from a pool of applicants to attend weekly discussions. During the discussions, participants split out into smaller breakout groups, each with a facilitator (but the groups and the facilitator can change every week).
* Run the fellowship through a series of regular one-on-one meetings (or one-on-two meetings). The facilitator’s time commitment is greater with this model, but some groups report that 1-1 dynamics feel more warm and supportive than large group discussions. Additionally, facilitators can tailor the programme to the individuals involved. EA St Andrews and Stanford EA have tried this model. EA St Andrews now uses a combination of 1:1 meetings and group meetings.

## Fellowship advertising
<a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/tips/advertising-your-ea-programs/">We have a separate page</a> with tips on how to advertise your fellowship and attract as many applicants as possible.

<a name="selection"></a>


## Fellowship Selection Process
Most groups have an application process for their fellowship. Some groups simply have applicants fill out a form, while others will interview candidates. Having a lengthier application process can filter out people who may not be as interested upfront, which may or may not be the outcome you want. Some groups also report that participants are more committed and have better attendance after going through a more demanding application process.  


Groups vary in how selective they are with their candidates. This raises similar trade-offs as having a lengthier application process. Yale switched from a more selective process to a less selective one because they <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/yZyncMoXjz75eWX4h/yale-ea-s-fellowship-application-scores-were-not-predictive">found out their assessment of applicants was not predictive of future engagement</a>. However, <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/Ddxn2mefAHEEYEf9t/lse-ea-s-fellowship-application-scores-moderately-predicted">LSE has a slightly different experience</a>.

When you're assessing applications, we recommend anonymizing them when you evaluate them, e.g. by giving a black background to the square where people put their names.


<a name="diverse"></a>


## Encouraging Diverse Applications


Yale EA has had some success encouraging a more diverse group of people to apply by adding to their information: "We are committed to building a diverse cohort of Fellows. There is some evidence suggesting that underprivileged individuals tend to underestimate their abilities. We do not want the application process to dissuade potential candidates and we strongly encourage interested students to apply regardless of gender, race, ethnicity, nationality, physical ability, etc. We also encourage both undergraduate, graduate and professional students, as well as individuals from all intellectual backgrounds and majors to apply."

## Cause-Area Fellowships
Some groups run fellowships focused on giving people a strong familiarity with one cause area. Here are some cause area fellowships groups have run in the past:

**Animal Welfare**

* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1axJhQQntgVabPUhUUWCbO-gxKyv-NgPbpk3nk5EYgWM/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=102086140992837504087">EA Oxford's Wild Animal Welfare Fellowship</a>: The curriculum was created by Bella Forristal (<a target="_blank" href="mailto:bellaforristal@gmail.com">bellaforristal@gmail.com</a>) with input from staff at Wild Animal Initiative. Groups familiar with basic EA arguments for animal welfare could skip or shorten weeks 2 and 3. Facilitators don't need any prior experience in wild animal welfare.

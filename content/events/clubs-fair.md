This guide was compiled with resources from LEAN, CEA, EA Oxford, Harvard EA, Haverford EA, EA Wooster, EA Cambridge, EA Oberlin and 80,000 Hours.

The optimal approach to presenting EA at a Clubs Fair will vary between universities, size and age of group etc. This guide aims to compile the key ingredients for a successful Clubs Fair, according to different groups’ experiences. 

Many groups have produced their own guides for the Clubs Fair, which are listed under <a href="#indepth">‘In-Depth Guides’</a>.

# What is Tabling?

Tabling is when a university group sets up a table to promote their group to passing students. The most common time to set up a table is the Clubs Fair. In many universities groups are allowed to also set up their table in a time and place where there is a lot of foot traffic, e.g. near the cafeteria around lunchtime. The advice on this page is mostly focussed on Clubs Fairs, but most of the advice can be applied to other tabling opportunities. 

<a name="what"></a>
# What is a Clubs Fair?
A Clubs Fair (otherwise known as Freshers’ Fair, Activities’ Fair, or Orientation) is the annual or bi-annual student extracurricular fair most universities host. Usually held over a few hours or a few days at the beginning of the term, student groups can register for a table and talk to students who might be interested in joining their group. Many students will be using this event to figure out what groups to get involved with, so this is an excellent opportunity to find new people (especially first-year students) to get involved in your EA group.


<a name="aims"></a>
# Aims of Attending the Fair 

1. **To get people to sign up for your group’s mailing list or equivalent.** Some groups take this opportunity to gain as many sign-ups as possible. This approach prioritises quick interactions with as many people as possible, following the reasoning that it is hard to gauge people’s genuine interest at a Clubs Fair and optimising for sign-ups gives as many people as possible the opportunity to engage with the group further. Read more about this approach in this <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TFyJC9XCD3Xp99uh8/optimizing-activities-fairs-1">forum post about Oxford’s Clubs Fair</a>. This approach can work well in fast-paced crowded Clubs Fairs, however, you want to avoid giving a bad impression by being too aggressive or salesy when asking for sign-ups. We want people’s first exposure to reflect the kindness and thoughtfulness that the movement is based on. Each university has a different Clubs Fair atmosphere, so check out how other clubs are soliciting mailing list sign-ups, and check your approach isn’t going to stand out for being too aggressive.  
2. **To briefly introduce effective altruism and give people a chance to interact with your group**.  If your university’s Clubs Fair is fairly quiet or you are doing tabling at other times of the year you will have enough time to have longer conversations and could do an engaging activity such as a Lightning Giving Game where participants get to choose which charity to donate some money to. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkMoh3g_iTNtF7FXyDnF6UPnUnEe3MwXwBAa2XDhhDM/edit#">This guide has more information on how to run Lightning Giving Games</a>. 
3. **To invite people to meet for a** <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/tips/one-on-ones/">**one-on-one**</a>. Regardless of your approach, it is important to make a note of people who seem especially interested in EA when you speak to them, and either ask them if they want to have a one-on-on during your conversation or follow up with them afterwards. You could also include an option for people to sign-up for a one-on-one while signing up for your mailing list. 
4. **To encourage people to attend your first event**. Aim to run your first event within a week of the Clubs Fair, and to send out an email advertising the event to your new sign-ups very soon after the fair. You can also mention the event in conversations during the Clubs Fair, and perhaps have a poster or handout advertising the event.
5. **To identify other people who are already familiar with, and interested in, EA**. These could be the most useful connections, especially if your club is new, as they might be interested in taking leadership roles. Follow up with these people with a one-on-one soon after the Fair. 


<a name="before"></a>
# Before the Fair 
1. **Find out about what your group can do at that Clubs Fair**. Seek for information from your Student Union (or other organisation at your university that administers clubs) whether your group can participate in the clubs fair, what the fair involves, and whether they have funding for you to get materials for your table. 
2. **Apply for money to cover costs**. If your Student Union will not provide sufficient funding, you can apply to <a target="_blank" href="https://efctv.org/groupfunding">CEA’s Group Support Funding</a>. You can include Clubs Fair costs within an application for General Group Funding. 
3. **Prepare your system for collecting sign-ups**. You may choose to use paper sign-up forms which you type up later. If you do this ensure the spaces for the email address is large, and that you check the writing is legible before the person leaves the table. Alternatively, you can use digital sign-up forms on phones or laptops, such as the in-built Mailchimp Sign-up form (<a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7ede1e5d01354f0948ab39411&id=da2372681e">see this example from Haverford EA</a>), a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Form</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>. Even if you do use digital forms, it is worth having a few paper sign-up forms as a backup. 
4. **Recruit volunteers to help out at your stall**. Where possible, try to have multiple people at the stall at once so that they can support each other, allow each other to take breaks, and talk to as many people as possible. Also, try to have some diversity among volunteers to make the group appear welcoming to a range of people. This can be achieved by scheduling your volunteers’ shifts in advance.
5. **Prepare yourself and your volunteers**. Volunteers should be able to succinctly and accurately describe EA and your group’s activities. It can be good to have a training meeting with volunteers in advance, during which you can:
    a. Motivate your volunteers by explaining why the Clubs Fair is so important
    b. Explain exactly what your goals are for the fair (e.g. collecting as many mailing list sign-ups as possible) and why
    c. Offer an example pitch and give volunteers time to practise pitching to each other so they can receive feedback
   d. Make sure everyone knows how to access the system for collecting sign-ups
   e. Give volunteers some written guidance for them to take away and digest. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWdwsa60JtTrUSoP7kCvLDA0dC5Mpx7LGjzcMsSJ98g/edit?usp=sharing">Here’s an example handout</a>.

6. **Prepare your stall**. Book your stall with the Student Union. If you have a large group you might be able to ask (or pay for) extra tables so your stall is prominent. 

   Here’s a suggested checklist of items:

   * Table Cloth
   * Posters and Banners (<a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/graphics/editable-graphics/#banners">modifiable posters and banner images are available here</a>). Posters and/or banners should clearly have the group name and a short description or pitch of effective altruism since most people won’t know what “effective altruism” means. If your posters and banners include photographs or pictures, make sure to include images representing a variety of EA cause areas, so people with a variety of relevant interests could be attracted to your table. Make sure you figure out how they will be displayed beforehand in case you need to bring any extra items.
   * Flyers (<a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/graphics/editable-graphics/#brochures">modifiable flyers are available here</a>). Flyers should ideally list the time and location of your first event, and a shortened link (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>) to your mailing list.
   * Stationery (sellotape, clips, large pieces of cardboard etc. in case you need to hoist banners and posters or tape down flyaway materials).
   * Several fully charged laptops, tablets or smartphones for sign-ups.
   * Paper signup sheets and pens in case you run out of power or if that’s you’re preferred method.
   * Food and water for your volunteers.
   * EA-branded T-shirts for your volunteers.
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zkMoh3g_iTNtF7FXyDnF6UPnUnEe3MwXwBAa2XDhhDM/edit#">Lightning Giving Game Materials</a> if you choose to run one of these games. 



<a name="during"></a>
# During the Fair

1. **Approach people**. If you’re aiming to maximise your number of sign-ups, you will need to attract people’s attention as they walk past your stall, rather than only speaking to people who approach you first. This can feel awkward at first, but usually becomes much easier after a small amount of practice. Read more about how to approach people in the pitch guides linked below. 
2. **Lightning Giving Games**. Some groups have run quick giving games during the Clubs Fair - this approach will likely result in fewer sign-ups, but allows individuals more time to interact with your group members. See here for guidance on running Lightning Giving Games. 
3. **Give your 'pitch'**.  <a href="#pitch">Ideas for pitches are below</a>.
4. **Stay motivated**. Make sure your volunteers take adequate breaks according to their needs. You might choose to motivate yourself and your team by keeping track of how many sign-ups or conversations you’re getting every 30 minutes and try to beat your own record.

# Sample Pitches
The basic components of the pitch are the **opening** (e.g. ‘Hello’, ‘Have you heard of effective altruism?’ etc.), the **spiel** (summarising EA), **the sell** (what your group offers), and the **call to action** (encouraging them to sign up). Over the course of the day, you can experiment with your pitch and see what works, what feels comfortable, and what best achieves your aims (whether that’s getting sign-ups or sparking interesting conversations).

Below are some example pitches to get you started. In any of these pitches, if someone doesn’t want you to continue speaking to them, just say ‘No problem, have a great day’ and move onto the next person. 

### Quick Pitch

[Opening] Hi there, do you want to do good with your career?

   _If they say ‘Yes’_

[Spiel] Great! We're Effective Altruism X. We're part of a growing social movement that's interested in using evidence and reason to figure out the best way to help others. [Sell] We're interested in how we can use our careers to have the greatest social impact. [Call to action] We can send you more details on email if you sign up here (push laptop in front of them) and we'll let you know when we're running events.

  _Offer them the laptop / form to sign up_

### More theory-focused

[Opening] Hi, have you heard of effective altruism?

   _If they say 'No'_

[Spiel] Cool! Effective altruism is a global community of people trying to figure out how to improve the world as much as possible using evidence and reason. It turns out some ways of helping people might be orders of magnitude more effective than other ways, so it seems really important to figure out what those ways are.

[Sell] Our groups hosts speakers, workshops, and a weekly discussion group aimed at helping our members build their plans for how they will help improve the world. 	

  _If they say ‘Yes’_

Combine [Spiel] and [Sell], e.g. Oh cool! Our group runs events all about this question of working out how to do as much as good as possible using evidence and reason. For example, we run speaker events, workshops, and a weekly discussion group aimed at helping our members build their plans for how they will help improve the world.

  _If they’re still interested_

[Call to action] We’ll let you know about the details through our mailing list - you can sign up here.

### More group-focused

[Opening] Do you want to do good with your life?

   _If they say ‘Yes’_

[Spiel/Sell] We’re X Effective Altruism. We run events about which career to choose, which charities to donate to, and which causes to support if you want to have a big social impact. For instance, we have Y next week [where Y is a really cool sounding event]. Does that sound good? 

   _If they say ‘Yes’_

[Call to action] Sign up to the newsletter and we’ll send you a single email outlining all our events this term.

   _If they seem unsure_

If you’re not interested, you can unsubscribe in one click.

### Career-focused

[Opening] Hey, do you want to make a difference with your career?

   _If they stop and look at you/say ‘Yes’_

Hi, I’m XXX, good to meet you.

[Spiel]​ We're from Effective Altruism X. Did you know that you have 80,000 Hours in your working career - that's a bit scary, isn't it? We're about using that time to have the most positive impact on the world. Sound good?

   _If they say ‘Yes’_

[Sell] At the moment, there's almost no advice that really addresses how you can choose a worthwhile career in which you make a real difference - typically careers services don't think about things like ethical impact as a major point. As a student society, we put on talks from lots of people who've gone into careers doing lots of good, as well as more personal events such as workshops and one to one coaching. This term we've got loads of events, ranging from XXX, to XXX.

[Call to action] Sound good? Let's get you signed up!

### More tips

More ideas for ‘pitches’ and other tips can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/learn/communicate-ea/">Communicating about EA guide</a>.  

Keep in mind that framing these conversations as ‘pitches’ could cause you to come across as overly salesy.  Your aim is to provide enough information so that the person you are talking to can decide whether they are interested in learning more.   

While you want to paint EA in the best light, remember that EA won’t be for everyone and that’s okay.

# After the Fair
1. **Thank your volunteers**. Perhaps buy them food or go and hang out somewhere afterwards.
2. **Follow up with your new sign-ups**. If you used paper sign-up forms, type up the email addresses as soon as possible. Send out a welcome email informing them of the details of your first event, and perhaps telling them a bit more about the society.
3. **Schedule one-on-ones**. The sooner you do this, the less likely people will have become busy with work or other club activities.

This guide was compiled with resources from LEAN, CEA, EA Oxford, Harvard EA, Haverford EA, EA Wooster, EA Cambridge, EA Oberlin and 80,000 Hours.

The optimal approach to presenting EA at a Clubs Fair will vary between universities, size and age of group etc. This guide aims to compile the key ingredients for a successful Clubs Fair, according to different groups’ experiences. 

Many groups have produced their own guides for the Clubs Fair, which are listed under <a href="#indepth">‘In-Depth Guides’</a>.

# What is Tabling?

Tabling is when a university group sets up a table to promote their group to passing students. The most common time to set up a table is the Clubs Fair. In many universities groups are allowed to also set up their table in a time and place where there is a lot of foot traffic, e.g. near the cafeteria around lunchtime. The advice on this page is mostly focussed on Clubs Fairs, but most of the advice can be applied to other tabling opportunities. 

<a name="what"></a>
# What is a Clubs Fair?
A Clubs Fair (otherwise known as Freshers’ Fair, Activities’ Fair, or Orientation) is an annual or bi-annual student extracurricular fair that most universities host. Usually held over a few hours or a few days at the beginning of the term, student groups can register for a table and talk to students who might be interested in joining their group. Many students will be using this event to figure out what groups to get involved with, so this is an excellent opportunity to find new people (especially first-year students) to get involved in your EA group.


<a name="aims"></a>
# Aims of Attending the Fair 

1. **To get people to sign up for your group’s mailing list or equivalent.** Some groups take this opportunity to gain as many sign-ups as possible. This approach prioritises quick interactions with as many people as possible, following the reasoning that it is hard to gauge people’s genuine interest at a Clubs Fair and optimising for sign-ups gives as many people as possible the opportunity to engage with the group further. Read more about this approach in this <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/TFyJC9XCD3Xp99uh8/optimizing-activities-fairs-1">forum post about Oxford’s Clubs Fair</a>. This approach can work well in fast-paced crowded Clubs Fairs, however, you want to avoid giving a bad impression by being too aggressive or salesy when asking for sign-ups. We want people’s first exposure to reflect the kindness and thoughtfulness that the movement is based on. Each university has a different Clubs Fair atmosphere, so check out how other clubs are soliciting mailing list sign-ups, and check your approach isn’t going to stand out for being too aggressive.  
2. **To briefly introduce effective altruism and give people a chance to interact with your group**.  If your university’s Clubs Fair is fairly quiet or you are doing tabling at other times of the year you will have enough time to have longer conversations and could do an engaging activity such as a Lightning Giving Game where participants get to choose which charity to donate some money to. <a href="#lightning">This section has more information on how to run Lightning Giving Games</a>. 
3. **To invite people to meet for a** <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/tips/one-on-ones/">**one-on-one**</a>. Make a note of people who seem especially interested in EA when you speak to them, and either ask them if they want to have a one-on-on during your conversation or follow up with them afterwards via email to invite them for a one-on-one meeting. You could also include an option for people to sign-up for a one-on-one while signing up for your mailing list. 
4. **To encourage people to attend your first event**. Aim to run your first event within a week of the Clubs Fair, and to send out an email advertising the event to your new sign-ups very soon after the fair. You can also mention the event in conversations during the Clubs Fair, and perhaps have a poster or handout advertising the event.
5. **To identify other people who are already familiar with, and interested in, EA**. These could be the most useful connections, especially if your club is new, as they might be interested in taking leadership roles. Follow up with these people with a one-on-one soon after the Fair. 


<a name="before"></a>
# Before the Fair 
1. **Find out about what your group can do at that Clubs Fair**. Seek for information from your Student Union (or other organisation at your university that administers clubs) whether your group can participate in the clubs fair, what the fair involves, and whether they have funding for you to get materials for your table. 
2. **Apply for money to cover costs**. If your Student Union will not provide sufficient funding, you can apply for <a target="_blank" href="https://efctv.org/gpsupf">CEA’s Group Support Funding</a>. You can include Clubs Fair costs within an application for General Group Funding. 
3. **Prepare your system for collecting sign-ups**. You may choose to use paper sign-up forms which you type up later. If you do this ensure the spaces for the email address is large, and that you check the writing is legible before the person leaves the table. Alternatively, you can use digital sign-up forms on phones or laptops, such as the in-built Mailchimp Sign-up form (<a target="_blank" href="https://facebook.us19.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=7ede1e5d01354f0948ab39411&id=da2372681e">see this example from Haverford EA</a>), a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/forms/about/">Google Form</a> or a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.typeform.com/">Typeform</a>. Even if you do use digital forms, it is worth having a few paper sign-up forms as a backup. 
4. **Recruit volunteers to help out at your stall**. Where possible, try to have multiple people at the stall at once so that they can support each other, allow each other to take breaks, and talk to as many people as possible. Also, try to have some diversity among volunteers to make the group appear welcoming to a range of people. This can be achieved by scheduling your volunteers’ shifts in advance.
5. **Prepare yourself and your volunteers**. Volunteers should be able to succinctly and accurately describe EA and your group’s activities. It can be good to have a training meeting with volunteers in advance, during which you can:

      a. Motivate your volunteers by explaining why the Clubs Fair is so important

      b. Explain exactly what your goals are for the fair (e.g. collecting as many mailing list sign-ups as possible) and why

      c. Offer an example pitch and give volunteers time to practise pitching to each other so they can receive feedback

      d. Make sure everyone knows how to access the system for collecting sign-ups

      e. Give volunteers some written guidance for them to take away and digest. <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wWdwsa60JtTrUSoP7kCvLDA0dC5Mpx7LGjzcMsSJ98g/edit?usp=sharing">Here’s an example handout</a>.

6. **Prepare your stall**. Book your stall with the Student Union. If you have a large group you might be able to ask (or pay) for extra tables so your stall is prominent. Here’s a suggested checklist of items:

   * Table Cloth
   * Posters and Banners (<a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/graphics/editable-graphics/#banners">modifiable posters and banner images are available here</a>). Posters and/or banners should clearly have the group name and a short description or pitch of effective altruism since most people won’t know what “effective altruism” means. If your posters and banners include photographs or pictures, make sure to include images representing a variety of EA cause areas, so people with a variety of relevant interests could be attracted to your table. Make sure you figure out how they will be displayed beforehand in case you need to bring any extra items.
   * Flyers (<a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/graphics/editable-graphics/#brochures">modifiable flyers are available here</a>). Flyers should ideally list the time and location of your first event, and a shortened link (i.e. <a target="_blank" href="https://bitly.com/">bit.ly</a>) to your mailing list.
   * Stationery (sellotape, clips, large pieces of cardboard etc. in case you need to hoist banners and posters or tape down flyaway materials).
   * Several fully charged laptops, tablets or smartphones for sign-ups.
   * Paper signup sheets and pens in case you run out of power or if that’s you’re preferred method.
   * Food and water for your volunteers.
   * EA-branded T-shirts for your volunteers.
   * <a href="#lightning">Lightning Giving Game Materials</a> if you choose to run one of these games. 


<a name="during"></a>
# During the Fair

1. **Approach people**. If you’re aiming to maximise your number of sign-ups, you will need to attract people’s attention as they walk past your stall, rather than only speaking to people who approach you first. This can feel awkward at first, but usually becomes much easier after a small amount of practice. Read more about how to approach people in the pitch guides linked below. 
2. **Lightning Giving Games**. Some groups have run quick giving games during the Clubs Fair - this approach will likely result in fewer sign-ups, but allows individuals more time to interact with your group members. See here for guidance on running Lightning Giving Games. 
3. **Give your 'pitch'**.  <a href="#pitch">Ideas for pitches are below</a>.
4. **Stay motivated**. Make sure your volunteers take adequate breaks according to their needs. You might choose to motivate yourself and your team by keeping track of how many sign-ups or conversations you’re getting every 30 minutes and try to beat your own record.

# Sample Pitches
The basic components of the pitch are the **opening** (e.g. ‘Hello’, ‘Have you heard of effective altruism?’), the **spiel** (summarising EA), **the sell** (what your group offers), and the **call to action** (encouraging them to sign up). Over the course of the day, you can experiment with your pitch and see what works, what feels comfortable, and what best achieves your aims (whether that’s getting sign-ups or sparking interesting conversations).

Below are some example pitches to get you started. In any of these pitches, if someone doesn’t want you to continue speaking to them, just say ‘No problem, have a great day’ and move onto the next person. 

### Quick Pitch

[Opening] Hi there, do you want to do good with your career?

_If they say ‘Yes’_

[Spiel] Great! We're Effective Altruism X. We're part of a growing social movement that's interested in using evidence and reason to figure out the best way to help others. [Sell] We're interested in how we can use our careers to have the greatest social impact. [Call to action] We can send you more details on email if you sign up here (push laptop in front of them) and we'll let you know when we're running events.

*Offer them the laptop / form to sign up*

### More theory-focused

[Opening] Hi, have you heard of effective altruism?

_If they say 'No'_

[Spiel] Cool! Effective altruism is a global community of people trying to figure out how to improve the world as much as possible using evidence and reason. It turns out some ways of helping people might be orders of magnitude more effective than other ways, so it seems really important to figure out what those ways are.

[Sell] Our groups hosts speakers, workshops, and a weekly discussion group aimed at helping our members build their plans for how they will help improve the world. 	

_If they say ‘Yes’_

Combine [Spiel] and [Sell], e.g. Oh cool! Our group runs events all about this question of working out how to do as much as good as possible using evidence and reason. For example, we run speaker events, workshops, and a weekly discussion group aimed at helping our members build their plans for how they will help improve the world.

_If they’re still interested_

[Call to action] We’ll let you know about the details through our mailing list - you can sign up here.

### More group-focused

[Opening] Do you want to do good with your life?

_If they say ‘Yes’_

[Spiel/Sell] We’re X Effective Altruism. We run events about which career to choose, which charities to donate to, and which causes to support if you want to have a big social impact. For instance, we have Y next week [where Y is a really cool sounding event]. Does that sound good? 

_If they say ‘Yes'_

[Call to action] Sign up to the newsletter and we’ll send you a single email outlining all our events this term.

_If they seem unsure_

If you’re not interested, you can unsubscribe in one click.

### Career-focused

[Opening] Hey, do you want to make a difference with your career?

_If they stop and look at you or say ‘Yes’_

Hi, I’m XXX, good to meet you.

[Spiel]​ We're from Effective Altruism X. Did you know that you have 80,000 Hours in your working career - that's a bit scary, isn't it? We're about using that time to have the most positive impact on the world. Sound good?

_If they say ‘Yes’_

[Sell] At the moment, there's almost no advice that really addresses how you can choose a worthwhile career in which you make a real difference - typically careers services don't think about things like ethical impact as a major point. As a student society, we put on talks from lots of people who've gone into careers doing lots of good, as well as more personal events such as workshops and one to one coaching. This term we've got loads of events, ranging from XXX, to XXX.

[Call to action] Sound good? Let's get you signed up!

### More tips

More ideas for ‘pitches’ and other tips can be found in the <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/learn/communicate-ea/">Communicating about EA guide</a>.  

Keep in mind that framing these conversations as ‘pitches’ could cause you to come across as overly salesy.  Your aim is to provide enough information so that the person you are talking to can decide whether they are interested in learning more.   

While you want to paint EA in the best light, remember that EA won’t be for everyone and that’s okay.


<a name="after"></a>
# After the Fair
1. **Thank your volunteers**. Perhaps buy them food or go and hang out somewhere afterwards.
2. **Follow up with your new sign-ups**. If you used paper sign-up forms, type up the email addresses as soon as possible. Send out a welcome email informing them of the details of your first event, and perhaps telling them a bit more about the society.
3. **Schedule one-on-ones**. The sooner you do this, the less likely people will have become busy with work or other club activities.

# Lightning Giving Games
## What is a Lightning Giving Game?
Offers of money are good for attracting attention, and interactive activities are good at getting people to engage. Lightning Giving Games can do both of these things. They are usually run at universities, during Clubs Fairs or other tabling opportunities. They involve giving $1 (or a similar amount in local currency) to each participant to donate it to one of 2-4 charities. 

<a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/7qCyvv8P7MGa39WtH/lessons-from-running-harvard-effective-altruism">Ben Kuhn from Harvard EA describes how he used a Giving Game</a> to attract people to his club. 

## Aims
* Attract people to your table
* Get people thinking about different approaches to doing good
* Give you more of an opportunity to talk * about effective altruism and your group
* Additional aims are listed under each approach to choosing charities

## Types of Lightning Giving Games
### Approach 1: 3 excellent charities with a range of cause areas

**Aims:**  

* Show the breadth of EA
* Demonstrate the challenges of choosing between different cause areas. 

**Cons:**

* Some participants immediately write off cause areas they don’t think are important, or choose the cause area they already like the best, without engaging with the details about the charity.  
* Some participants might feel they are being asked to compare things that are two different. 

**Charity ideas:**

* One global health and poverty charity E.g. 
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>  (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
* One animal charity e.g.
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://thehumaneleague.org/">The Humane League</a> (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://animalcharityevaluators.org/donation-advice/recommended-charities/">Animal Charity Evaluators</a>)
* One charity that aims to reduce catastrophic risks, e.g. 
   * Climate charity such as <a target="_blank" href="https://www.rainforestcoalition.org/">Coalition for Rainforest Nations</a> (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/climate-change-executive-summary">Founders Pledge</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.centerforhealthsecurity.org/">Pandemic Risk charity (e.g. <a target="_blank" href="">John Hopkins Center for Health Security</a>, recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://founderspledge.com/stories/existential-risk-executive-summary">Founders Pledge</a>)


**Notes on choosing charities:**

* We don’t recommend including any meta-EA charities. For meta-EA charities to be appealing, a person has to fully buy into EA being important first, and a Giving Game is just the start of this process. 
* Avoid charities that would take a while to explain what they do, or what the merit is of this charity. For example, we don’t recommend choosing an AI Safety charity because many people won’t immediately agree that AI is a large threat to humanity. 
* Harvard EA conducted an experiment that suggested <a target="_blank" href="http://www.harvardea.org/blog/2015/9/12/heas-spring-2014-research?rq=%22giving%20game%22">speculative charities such as 80,000 Hours and Machine Intelligence Research Institute are less likely to result in email list sign-ups than global health charities</a>.


**Key points you could discuss in your game:**

* We have limited resources, so if you want to make a large positive impact it pays to consider what the best cause is for you to work on.
* Introduce EA, including information that shows EA isn’t just about donating:
* Scale, Tractability and Neglectedness
* EA looks at how we can do the most good we can with our available resources, including money, career and volunteering

**Resources:**

* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/17UmYAIneKhYOlmhw7sECo7YgpFOk-ihKIGnjC8lh7Ew/edit#slide=id.p3">This document has posters</a> for running a Lightning Giving Game with the Against Malaria Foundation, the Humane League, and John Hopkins Centre for Health Security

### Approach 2: Two-step Giving Game, with one excellent charity and one appealing but ineffective or harmful charity 

**Aims:**  

* Demonstrates that intuitions are not a good indication of whether a charity is harmful or helpful
* There is a wide difference in effectiveness between charities

**Cons:**

* Only covers one cause area. To counter this it would help to have a variety of posters representing different cause areas on your table.  
* It usually requires people to spend ~2 minutes talking with someone facilitating the game, otherwise, people might just put their money/token into a charity without reading or hearing about the charities. 

**Charity ideas:**

* One appealing but ineffective or harmful charity 
   * <a target="_blank" href="http://www.playpumps.co.za/">PlayPumps is a popular option (<a target="_blank" href="https://www-tc.pbs.org/frontlineworld/stories/southernafrica904/flash/pdf/unicef_pp_report.pdf">more information on PlayPumps</a>)
* One effective global health charity e.g. 
  * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>  (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.evidenceaction.org/dispensers-2017/">Evidence Action’s Dispensers for Safe Water</a> which is a good contrast to PlayPumps as they both aim to provide clean water (a <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/other-charities">GiveWell standout charity</a>)

**Notes on choosing charities:**

* Other charities people have chosen in the past have been Make-a-Wish Foundation (which has an average wish cost of several thousand dollars), and the local Guide Dog charity. We don’t recommend you use a Guide Dog charity, or other very popular local charities because this could be offputting for people who have benefitted from the charity (either directly, or through family and friends).  

**Key points you could discuss during or after your game:**

* We have limited resources, so if you want to make a large positive impact it pays to consider what the best cause is for you to work on.
* Introduce EA, including some information that demonstrates EA isn’t just about donating to global health charities
* EA looks at how we can do the most good we can with our available resources, including money, career and volunteering
* EA community works on a variety of cause areas

**How the game could work:**

* <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/19YDz3lLcyaBNVAINhVfmhhyORp9xExOI/edit">This resource has two pages per charity</a>. Show the first “initial information” page, state this is the sort of advertising information a charity might use, and explain what each of the charities do. Make sure you are positive about both charities.
* Get people to pick which charity they’d choose based on this information. 
* Then flip the pages over to show the “evidence” information, and explain what the evidence shows. 
* Give people an opportunity to ask questions.
* Then ask people to choose for a final time. 
* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1k73rGGdiI90vFl8Z1iOyLfTbJefgATM9">More information and FAQs about these two charities are here</a>. 

### Approach 3: Three Global Health Charities 

**Aims:**  

* Demonstrates the challenges of choosing * between different charities
Can use data to choose between charities 

**Cons:**

* Only covers one cause area. To counter this it would help to have a variety of posters representing different cause areas on your table.  

**Charity ideas:**

* Three effective global health charities e.g.
     * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.againstmalaria.com/">Against Malaria Foundation</a> (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givedirectly.org/">GiveDirectly</a>  (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://schistosomiasiscontrolinitiative.org/">Schistosomiasis Control Initiative</a> (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://www.hki.org/">Helen Keller International (recommended by <a target="_blank" href="https://www.givewell.org/charities/top-charities">GiveWell</a>)
  
**Notes on choosing charities:**

* GiveDirectly is a good charity to include because their approach contrasts with disease prevention charities and often sparks good discussions.

**Key points you could discuss in your game:**

* Most people choose charities or causes to support based on very little information.
* If we want to truly make a difference with our donation we should look at the evidence, and how much impact a charity can have with our donation. 
* EA looks at how we can do the most good we can with our available resources, including money, career and volunteering
* EA community works on a variety of cause areas

**Resources:**

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1k73rGGdiI90vFl8Z1iOyLfTbJefgATM9">Giving Game material</a> - this is for a long giving game involving the Against Malaria Foundation, GiveDirectly and Schistosomiasis Control Initiative, but the charity information provided can be trimmed to make a Lightning Giving Game. 


## Preparing to Run a Lightning Giving Game

1.  **Secure funding to donate to the charities**

    * Your university might have funding available for your group to spend on Clubs Fair activities
    * The Life You Can Save may <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hLtyGBgmWLxovGVH8f5n9tuiNKCxyJvg4KOb6XnQAQI/edit#heading=h.vzd7r26rxyzk">sponsor your Lightning Giving Game</a> if at least a 1/3 of the featured charities are from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.thelifeyoucansave.org/Top-Charities">The Life You Can Save’s recommended list</a>, all charities are tax-deductible in the US, email addresses are collected for the Life You Can Save, you fill out a post-game report afterwards.
    * <a target="_blank" href="https://efctv.org/groupfunding">Apply to CEA’s Group Support Funding</a>. You can include Giving Game costs within an application for General Group Funding. 

2. **Select 2 or 3 charities**
3. **Choose how people should submit their vote**. Some groups recommend not letting people see how many votes each charity has because they may try to help the less-popular charity. Other groups recommend showing the votes because it is visually attractive and will draw people to your table, if only to figure out what’s going on. Options:

    a) Get a pile of $1 notes or $1 coins to physically hand to people for them to donate. Your pitch can be to hold out the money and say “Do you want to donate this dollar to charity?”. If you have paper money you could create a board to pin your bills to:
<p class="large_image_wrapper">
 <img src="/img/lightninggg.jpg" />
</p>
If you have coins then use jars.

    b) If you prefer not to use real money, use ping-pong balls or marbles.

    c) Set up your board or containers and charity information on your table, along with other information about effective altruism. 
4. **Prepare what you are going to say**

    a) Getting participants: An effective opening line for Lightning Giving Games is “Do you want to donate someone else’s money to charity?”

    b) Describing the charities VERY briefly

    c) Giving an explanation of what EA is 

    d) Asking people to sign up for your group.

## Lightning Giving Games Checklist

* Posters with blurbs and photos of each charity 
* Money or tokens
* 50-200 (depending on the size of your fair)
Jars or Pin Board (with 50-200 pin tacks), labelled with names with each of the charities
* Sign up forms for your club
* Other posters or flyers about EA


## During the Game

* Each Game takes a few minutes, so try to get two or three people interested at once.
* Make sure you ask if they have any questions.
* Once they make their choice they can put the money in the container/on the board. 

## After the Game

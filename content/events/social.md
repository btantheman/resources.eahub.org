Social events, where people get together to enjoy each other's company, can be great for building a sense of community. Events can be structured or unstructured, EA-themed or otherwise!

# Structured or Unstructured?

Having a structure to your social event gets conversations flowing and helps people to get to know each other. Some structure is ideal in situations where:

* You are expecting people who are new to EA
* Many attendees don’t know each other
* Your group has people who dominate conversations
* You think a structured meeting would be more productive than an unstructured one

Unstructured socials require less organisation and allow people to talk about whatever they like. Running these is fine, but it's best to run some structured social events as well. If you're concerned about meetings getting formal, kick off with a casual activity to get everyone relaxed and familiar with each other.


An anecdote from one organiser: *“I ran a casual picnic with no structured conversation, and half the people that turned up were unfamiliar with EA. Several of them talked to each other about quite ineffective altruistic topics, probably thinking all along they were learning about EA. I attempted to guide their conversations a bit, but it came off a bit forced. In this situation, it would have been better to have some structure to the social event. Those new people would have gotten a more accurate picture of EA during their first event.”*

# General Information

General information about running an event can be found <a target="_blank" href="/events/guide/">here</a>. 

## Additional considerations for social events

Social events are supposed to be social (obviously!), but are sometimes a lot more social for people who already know each other, and can be less fun for new people, or people who are less confident conversationalists. Hosts should join people who are sitting by themselves, or who are listening but not contributing to the conversation, and make them feel welcomed. 

If you are expecting people who are new to EA to come along to your social event, it is helpful to give a short introduction to EA - either to the whole group, or invite new people to chat with some experienced members of the group to give them an overview. 

Check out the “<a target="_blank" href="/learn/communicate-ea/">Communicating about EA</a>” section for ideas on what to say in an introduction, or choose one of the <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/events/intro/#talks">short introductions to EA</a>. 

EA London <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/znuJ2Z48YnEjrGLvA/why-do-ea-events-attract-more-men-than-women-focus-group">analysed the gender split</a> of their events and found that their social events were male-dominated while other events (talks, reading groups) were gender-balanced, so it is worth considering whether your social events are appealing to a diverse group of people interested in EA.

# Non-EA Themed Activities

Some EA groups have arranged activities that are not EA related, but can be a great way to get involved 

* **Walk or Hike:** Going for a walk or hike can be ideal for naturally generating smaller two-person conversations, it is cheap, and is good exercise too! While many people like walking, some people may be hesitant to come if they don’t know how long, difficult or fast the walk will be, as it is never nice to feel left behind, or feel like you are struggling to keep up. Recommendations to reduce this problem:

  * Give a description and, if available, a map of the proposed walk, including the exact meeting location, distance, expected time, and approximate elevation gain if the area is hilly. Indicate if you think this is likely to be challenging for people with a low to moderate level of fitness. 
  * Have a plan B route in mind for if it looks like the group is travelling much slower than expected.
  * State on your event details that the walk will go at the pace of the slowest person, and enforce this on the walk by having a quiet word with people who are likely to be fast walkers, and suggesting slowing down and stopping. Sometimes people can get carried away walking faster while chatting, but if they’ve been told to stop at regular intervals (and at all intersections) and wait until everyone has caught up and has had a break before leaving again then this can be managed. 
  * As a facilitator, it is suggested that you bring a first aid kit, and give people a suggested list of items to bring in a backpack (water, raincoat, snacks). 
* **Meditation Events**
* **Obstacle courses**
* **Easy rock climbing**
* **Easy kayaking**
* **Soccer, frisbee, or some other team game**
* **Geocaching or Orienteering** (some areas have permanent courses set up and can be used for free)
* **Board Games, Card Games or Role Playing Game nights** - while a game doesn’t need to be EA related, these can be made EA related by choosing a game such as <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_(board_game)https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandemic_(board_game)">Pandemic</a>. Pandemic is a cooperative board game involves 2-4 players (up to 6 with expansion packs) fighting a global pandemic - thus making it EA related, although we can’t comment on its scientific accuracy. Other games that are cooperative or resource-oriented may also present interesting discussion topics.
* **Movie nights** - these can be made EA related by choosing an <a href="#movie">EA related movie
  </a>.
* **Vegan cooking classes** - this can be as simple as having some group members teaching other group members how to create their favourite dishes.

# EA Themed Activities



<a name="jeopardy"></a>

## EA Jeopardy

Jeopardy is a quiz game format where contestants or teams answer questions to get points. This <a target="_blank" href="https://jeopardylabs.com/play/effective-altruism-jeopardy">EA Jeopardy</a> game has a variety of questions already. Click “edit” and then clone the template so you can create your own version. A data projector or a large screen is required. 

<a name="wits"></a>

## Wits and Wagers

This is a game where people in teams of 2-4 people are given questions with numerical questions. Everyone’s answers are then displayed on the screen then each team bets some or all of their points on the answers they think are the closest. The real answer is revealed then points are awarded for the closest answer and the most accurate bets. 

This game can be a lot more engaging than regular quizzes because even if your team has no idea of the answers, you might be able to guess which of the other teams might know the answers and still win the game. There are also strategic decisions to make about betting. 

The excel spreadsheet contains all the instructions to set up and run the game. It also completes all the calculations for the quizmaster. 

The quizmaster will need to make up their own questions, and the quizmaster needs to find out the correct answers and enter the answers onto the spreadsheet before the game.

* <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=147kxzmBAgieKI0U9bP2zuYShn4RYb6kj">Excel spreadsheet with sample EA questions</a> (used by EA New Zealand)

Required: A computer with Excel installed and data projector.

<a name="quiz"></a>

## Quiz Night

Questions at quiz nights can be entirely EA-themed, but can also contain non-EA related questions. Ensure you choose your questions to suit your audience, as people may not enjoy the quiz if they can’t answer many questions. 

EA Penn has sample quiz questions, answers, and answers sheets <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KRRfGF7K-OYeISPYe7eSdr0osOdmD-wU">here</a>. 

<a name="eaagainsthumanity"></a>

## EA Against Humanity

<a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1I_0HCFlOXbaLaSxAkuZ9HTWDYuTDzbxHPtKaGtmSmzg/edit">EA Against Humanity</a> is a hilarious PG-13 and EA-themed adaptation of the party game "<a target="_blank" href="https://www.cardsagainsthumanity.com/?ref=bf2020">Cards Against Humanity</a>,” in which any number of players tries to respond to a prompt with the funniest answer they can. The game is suitable for involved group members as newcomers won't get many of the references, although you could choose to remove the more obscure references.

<a name="one-on-ones"></a>

## One-on-ones

One-on-one conversations between community members are often the highest-rated parts of EA retreats (as reported by <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/9ozoJpPoNBL6Z5BX5/a-lesson-from-an-ea-weekend-in-london-pairing-people-up-to">London</a> and New Zealand retreat attendees). These conversations can be arranged in regular social meetups if you don’t have the luxury of a retreat. While retreats often have 20 or 30 minute long conversations, for shorter events you may wish to have shorter times. 

While many people are happy to chat away without prompts, it can be nice to have a few suggested questions that can get people started. Here is a <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Z_8SUamsSm1bn_U5Lh9Q_AijWFN48AsMEpWBE8qtJY0/edit">list of 67 questions</a> that you can choose from.

# Articles

## Articles with pre-prepared questions or worksheets
* <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/events/fellowships/">EA Fellowship</a> curricula have a carefully curated list of readings with sample questions. If your group is not running a fellowship you can adapt this content to suit standalone discussion events. Most fellowships require a couple of hours of reading per week so you might want to choose a subset of that week’s reading unless your group has plenty of time to read between meetups. 
   * <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/15HJdBYFyeyG9yVbJ_QDvm811A9IHnC4Y">CEA/EA Oxford Introductory fellowship</a>. They have a full curriculum and an abridged reading list (1 hour of reading per session). Each week has sample questions to discuss and exercises that could be completed in small groups during the meetup. 
   * EA Oxford’s  <a target="_blank" href="https://eaoxford.com/indepthresources">In-Depth Fellowship curriculum</a>
   * Harvard EA’s <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/115EmISC1o4saiY9Cc-W1kRF4mtm1KOusA4B7dhzZujs/edit">Arete Fellowship curriculum</a>
* South Bay EA has an <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1qhY_hcD06LLtuc_aaW4SqWml6EnReUnp">extensive set of worksheets</a> that cover many EA related topics. Each topic has reading suggestions and a worksheet with discussion questions.


## Other good sources for articles
* <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/s/YCa8BRQoxKbmf5CJb">EA Introductory Program on the EA Forum</a> (this is a similar list of content to the CEA/EA Oxford Intro Fellowship)
* Many of the <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/allPosts?timeframe=allTime&sortedBy=top&karmaThreshold=-1000">top rated posts on the EA Forum</a> provide interesting discussion material.
* The average “karma” of EA Forum posts has risen over time, so the top-rated posts don’t capture the best classic posts. Instead check out this excellent  <a target="_blank" href="https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/XXAjiLpHsL8PXwovf/collection-of-good-2012-2017-ea-forum-posts-1">list of classic posts from 2012-2017</a>. 
*  <a target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/problem-profiles/"> 80,000 Hours’ Problem Profiles</a> cover many key cause areas of interest to the EA community 
* Lists of reading lists for different EA related topics:

   * EA Resource Hub lists (<a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/learn/about-ea/">Introductory</a>, <a target="_blank" href="https://resources.eahub.org/learn/reading-lists/">Topic specific</a>)

# Videos


<a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCEfASxwPxzsHlG5Rf1-4K9w">CEA’s YouTube channel</a> has recordings of EA Global and EAGx talks. Many of these talks are less than 30 minutes long if you don’t include the Q+A sections, so they can be played at the start of a meetup. This is a great option if your group members often don’t have the time to read much between meetups. 


Some of the <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLwp9xeoX5p8OoBBqv8t7JhVcgbjtXq3f7">2020 EA Student Summit talks</a> are particularly well suited to people newer to EA.

Some videos that groups have tried and found worked well:

# Books
<a name="books"></a>

Book clubs usually last for several weeks, with participants reading a chapter or two each week. <a target="_blank" href="https://www.centreforeffectivealtruism.org/group-support-funding/">CEA is able to provide funding to purchase books</a>.

Some books that groups have used in reading groups:

# Podcasts
<a name="podcasts"></a>

* The <a target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/">80,000 Hours podcast</a> is a great source of interesting EA related discussions. Note that many are very long, so you might want to let your group know the sections that you think are the most important, so time-poor members can listen to the essential parts. 
* <a target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/podcast/effective-altruism-an-introduction/"> Learn Effective Altruism</a> is a selection of ten 80,000 Hours podcast episodes selected to help listeners quickly get up to speed on effective altruism from a longtermist perspective.

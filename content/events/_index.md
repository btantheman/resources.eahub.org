This page includes plenty of suggested content with questions to get the discussion going, and tips on facilitating an interesting and positive discussion.

## [Introductory Presentations](/events/intro/)

A variety of ideas and resources for running structured and unstructured social get-togethers. 

## [Speaker Events](/events/speaker/)
Speaker events involve a guest speaker giving a presentation, workshop, Q&A, or panel discussion. This guide will help you invite and prepare for speaker events.

## Intermediate Workshops - _Coming Soon_

## Clubs Fairs and Tabling (Uni Groups) - _Coming Soon_
The clubs fair (otherwise known as Freshers’ Fair,  Activities’ Fair or Orientation) is the annual or bi-annual student extracurricular fair most Universities host at the beginning of the term. This is an excellent opportunity to find new people (especially first-years) to get involved in your EA group.


## [Fellowships (Uni Groups)](/events/fellowships)
EA fellowships involve a small group of admitted fellows gaining a complete education in introductory EA concepts over the course of several weeks. This page is a guide for uni groups running fellowships.

## [Retreats](/events/retreats)

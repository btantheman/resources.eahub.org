Getting the most out of an EA conference
EA conferences have been transformative experiences for some members of the community; they’ve led to changes in cause prioritisation and career paths, as well as significant increases in their ambition to improve the world. 

Although virtual conferences have a different atmosphere from in-person conferences, post-conference surveys indicate that much of the value of EA conferences comes from one-on-one conversations, which can be had online. 

It is possible that most of the impact of EA conferences comes from their effects on the small percentage of attendees who have these life-changing experiences. So it’s worth thinking about how to increase the chances that you or your group members could be among those attendees!

Suggestions for preparing for the conference:
Set aspirational goals (as well as more realistic goals). Think about who you would have to talk to, and what would have to happen at the conference, in order for you to achieve these goals. 
Prioritise scheduling one-on-ones over watching talks (which can be watched online after the conference). The EAGxVirtual organisers have stated that the main focus of the event will be one-on-one meetings between attendees, so you are strongly encouraged to reach out to arrange meetings! 
Consider hosting a pre-conference planning meetup for your group members that are attending the conference.

Advice for getting the most out of one-on-ones - by Marisa Jurczyk, with contributions from several community members.
Janique Behman from EA Zurich has created a Personal Goal-Setting Template to guide your planning for the conference as a whole, and a 1:1 Template to assist in the planning of important individual meetings. We also encourage you to schedule informal one-on-ones, which won’t need planning.

* Try this TED talk: “What are the most important moral problems of our time” by William MacAskill in 2018 (12 minutes). MacAskill outlines how we might work out what the most pressing problem is, and explains why existential risks—those that may derail civilisation permanently or cause human extinction—may be the most important cause for us to work on.

## Philosophy

EA is rooted in moral philosophy. For a philosophical introduction to the movement, read <a target="_blank" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1xs22x9UIuvym--MfAUtQsZ-GVqTqXeEs/view">this section of the Norton Introduction to Ethics</a>, by William MacAskill in 2019.

William MacAskill’s 2015 book <a target="_blank" href="https://www.effectivealtruism.org/doing-good-better/">Doing Good Better</a> is an entertaining and excellent introduction to EA - it mostly focuses on global poverty and effective charity, but also provides a review of other cause areas, and introduces how to use your career to make a large difference.  

<a name="causeprior"></a>
## Cause Prioritisation

Cause-impartiality— the concept that we should choose our cause area based on how much impact we could make— is one of the unique aspects of effective altruism.

<a target="_blank" href="https://80000hours.org/">80,000 Hours</a> explains a common approach to choosing a cause area to work on in this entertaining video.
